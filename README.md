**Initial Code**

```liquid

</div>

<style>
  /* CSS goes here */
</style>

<script>
  function addToCart() {
    // JS goes here
  }
</script>
```

You'll answer a series of questions and provide a small piece of code (if necessary).

1. Explain and provide an example of how you would create and manage a counter in JavaScript that increments every second.

4. How would you display different prices for logged-in and logged-out users using Liquid? Show some example code.
5. How would you make a responsive navigation bar? Outline your approach.
6. How would you use Shopify CLI to create a new theme and then deploy it to a development store? Walk me through the steps.
